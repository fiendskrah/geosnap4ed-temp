#  Definitions 
**[Commuting zone:](commuting_zone.md)**: Regions defined by the geographic boundaries of a local economy. We use the [ERS 2010 boundary definitions](https://sites.psu.edu/psucz/data/) which are the most recent commuting zone definitions. 

**[Geographic School Distric](geographic_school_district.md)**: The aggregate of all public schools in SEDA (except for special education or virtual schools) that are physically located within a geographically defined public Elementary or Unified school district. We use the [2019 Elementary and Unified School District Boundaries](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/DistrictBoundaries) to define these districts. Note that there are some districts in SEDA that are not geographically defined that are included in our analysis. In this document, we sometimes use the term *district* to refer to geographic school districts. 

**[Group](group.md)**: The term "group" refers to a subgroup-unit. For schools, the only available subgroup is all students. For geographic school districts, counties, commuting zones, metropolitan areas, and states, data for other subgroups are available when estimates are sufficiently precise. 

**[Metropolitan Statistical Area](metropolitan_statistical_area.md)**:  The [U.S. Census Bureau defines an MSA]((https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metromicro/about/glossary.html)) as a county or group of counties with a population exceeding 50,000 and encompassing an urban area, combined with any surrounding counties with strong commuting ties to the urban area. The Census Bureau revises the metropolitan statistical area definitions after each decennial census. We use the 2013 U.S. Census Bureau definitions, which are the [definitions based on the 2010 census](https://www.census.gov/programssurveys/metro-micro/geographies/geographic-reference-files.2013.html). 
We make one modification to the definitions: The Census defines very large metropolitan areas as Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (CMSAS); each CMSA is subdivided into Metropolitan Area Divisions. We treat each division as a separate metropolitan area for analysis purposes, as the CMSAs generally quite large.

**State**: States are identified by their FIPS state code. We include all 50 states plus Washington, DC. Data for Puerto Rico will be added in a future release of SEDA. 

**[Subgroup](subgroup.md)**: The term "subgroup" refers to the group of students to which an estimate pertains. 
	Subgroups include: all, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Multiracial, Native American, White, female, male, economically disadvantaged, and not economically disadvantaged students. 
	We do not currently report data for Multiracial or Native American subgroups. 

**Unit**: The term "unit" refers to the aggregation or the geography level of the data. This may be a school, geographic school district, county, commuting zone, metropolitan area, or state.
