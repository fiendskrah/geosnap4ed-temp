# Covariate Data Construction 
SEDA 4.0 contains CCD and ACS data that have been curated for use with the school, geographic school district, county, metropolitan area, and state achievement data. SEDA 4.0 differs from the prior version of SEDA in that it uses the new crosswalk files to aggregate the covariates to geographic school districts and counties, releases state-level covariate data and adds data for the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years.
