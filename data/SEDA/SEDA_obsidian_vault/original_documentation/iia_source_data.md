# Source Data
The SEDA 4.0 achievement data is constructed using data from the EDFacts data system housed by the U.S. Department of Education (USEd).

## Collection and state requirements
The EDFacts data system collects aggregated test score data from each state's standardized testing program as required by federal law. Specifically, each state is required to test every student in grades 3 through 8 in math and Reading Language Arts (RLA) each year. States have the flexibility to select or design a test of their choice that measures student achievement relative to the state's standards. Additionally, states set their own benchmarks or thresholds for the levels of performance, e.g., "proficient," in each grade and subject. States select 2 to 5 performance levels, where one or more levels represent "proficient" grade-level achievement.

## Extent of EDFacts database 
To EDFacts, states report the number of students in each school, subgroup, subject, grade, and year scoring at each of their defined performance levels; no individual student-level data is reported. EDFacts currently contains these school assessment outcomes for ten consecutive school years from the 2008-09 school year to the 2017-18 school year in grades 3 to 8 in RLA and math. The student subgroups include race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic disadvantage, among others not used in SEDA 4.0.

## No supression
The raw EDFacts data used in SEDA include no suppressed cells, nor do they have a minimum cell size for reporting. Each row of data corresponds to a school-subgroup-subjectgrade-year cell.
