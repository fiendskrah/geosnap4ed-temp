# Versioning and Publication 
New or revised data will be posted periodically to the SEDA website. SEDA updates that contain substantially new information are labeled as a new version (e.g., V1.0, V2.0, etc.). Updates that make corrections or minor revisions to previously posted data are labeled as a subsidiary of the current version (e.g., V1.1, V1.2, etc.). 

When citing any SEDA data set for presentation, publication or use in the field, please include the version number in the citation. All versions of the data will remain archived and available on the SEDA website to facilitate data verification and research replication.
