# Get the data

Attendance zone files are too large to store in the github repository, please find them in the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1p0MqXE__XGlaMGKtajESA3eaFxBJkv03)

# Attendance zones

'Attendance zone' refers to an area around a given school from which the school gets it's students. These boundaries are not drawn in any standardized manner and are largely determined locally by school administrators, given economic and political realities within a school district. Attendance boundaries typically are contiguous with school districts, with boundaries around schools filling up a district, similar to counties within states, though it cannot be assumed that this will always be the case.

Geographic databases for attendance zones are very limited in quality and quantity, and are therefore the limiting factor in any analysis in which they are invovled.  

Attendance zones can be matched with their respective school via their `NCESSCH` code.

# SABINS 

The School Attendance Boundary Information System (SABINS) was a National Science Foundation-funded project to provide, free of charge, aggregate census data and GIS-compatible boundary files for school attendance areas, or school catchment areas, for selected areas in the United States for the 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12 school years.

For our purposes, the 2009-10 SABINS data year is the only attendance zone dataset of value. These are divided into separate boundaries per grade, meaning a single elementary school can have several zones, one for each grade. Previous works in the literature typically only use the first grade boundaries when performing any wide-scale econometric or demographic analysis. 

# SABS

The **School Attendance Boundary Survey (SABS)** was an experimental survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) with assistance from the U.S. Census Bureau to collect school attendance boundaries for the 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 school years. The SABS collection includes boundaries for more than 70,000 schools in over 12,000 school districts throughout the U.S. As of September 2021, SABS is the most current, complete database of U.S. school attendance zones.
