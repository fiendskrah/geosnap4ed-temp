# Districts

This directory contains information regarding data for school districts, which...

> ...are geographic entities and single purpose governmental units that operate schools and provide public educational services at the local level. The Census Bureau collects school district boundaries to develop annual estimates of children in poverty to help the U.S. Department of Education determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts. 

>NCES also uses the school district boundaries to develop a broad collection of district-level demographic estimates from the Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey. The Census Bureau annually updates school district boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels based on information provided by state education officials.
