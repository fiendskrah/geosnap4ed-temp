**Describe the example you are interested in**

- I want to understand whether neighborhoods are changing more dramatically around under-performing schools
- I have a dataset on the location of afterschool training centers. Which schools have the worst accessibility to these resources?


**Describe how you think `geosnap` could be useful in this example (or why it needs to be modified to suit the example at hand)**

- the `geosnap` tutorial does not show me how to compute accessibility scores before including them in a cluster analysis
- I know `geosnap` can be used to model neighborhood change, but I want to use school catchment boundaries as my representation of neighborhoods


**Describe the output you would like to see generated**

- a jupyter notebook that demonstrates code I could adapt to my use-case
- an interactive interface that allows me to explore how different parameters would affect the results of the analysis
